## Time format converter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Toggle between **AM/PM** or **24-hour** notation\(\*\) format to see current time or pick a specific time you need.
Visual analog data (sun and moon icons) complete the "time translation".

\(\*\)*in American and Canadian English is also called "military time", though it is not equivalent to military notation.*
